# TODO

  - Respect markdown syntax, esp. lists

    For inspiration on what should be respected when wrapping, refer to the [Wrap Plus](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Wrap%20Plus) Sublime Text plugin.

    Also take inspiration from the VS-Code plugin that hard-wraps text.

  - need to define paragraph boundaries?

    look at the textfilter command of the micro docs

  - use my str_wrap instead of fmt
